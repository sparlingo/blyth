# Sauce for the goose...

## Purpose

Discussions among friends are wonderful, espcieally with a few beers. I often take things towards politics and economics, in fact I almost always do because that's my interest and I have a passion for it and for the past few years many of these discussions have been about China and it's position. If I speak to what I know about the widest possible view on China's fiscal position, if I use the language that is common among economics I get mostly quite befuddled looks and often serious pushback. If I'm "anti-China" in my outlook it's purely because that's where I think the numbers and the indicators lead, and I'm creating this document so that people can understand my views and why I say the strange things that I do.
