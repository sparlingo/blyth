## Purpose

Discussions among friends are wonderful, espcieally with a few beers. I often take things towards politics and economics, in fact I almost always do because that's my interest and I have a passion for it and for the past few years many of these discussions have been about China and it's position. If I speak to what I know about the widest possible view on China's fiscal position, if I use the language that is common among economics I get mostly quite befuddled looks and often serious pushback. If I'm "anti-China" in my outlook it's purely because that's where I think the numbers and the indicators lead, and I'm creating this document so that people can understand my views and why I say the strange things that I do.

### Profiles of the Urban Chinese

Here I will outline what a typical profile might be for the various age cohorts in China today, what the world would look like for them as they "come of age". When you graduate school and the state of the economy at that time have great effects on your long-term outcomes and China has experienced a greatly accelerated development path for the past 40 years and the image that many people have of an unbroken line of development can easily be augmented by a little bit of deeper thought and inquiry into the matter.

This and the post 70s generation are the sweet spot of the curve.

When the Cultural Revolution began this group were not yet born, sparing them the direct traumas from this time of troubles. They were born and quite young when the Reform and Opening period began in 1978, and they were groomed to renew the promise of China's new age after it's careening off the cliff when Mao grabbed the steering wheel again in 1976..

Any analysis of the financial position of Chinese people would be incomplete without doing an analysis of the structure of Chinese families since the idea that people are simply independent economic entities is laughable anyway, even more true in a society like China.

#### Post 2000s group

This group are hopeless. Confident, prideful, nationalistic, fucked for life. Yes that's hyperbole, but when your wages are going to be lower than your parents and you have to buy the world's most expensive housing: that's what you are.
